# ToDoList
My first iOS app

It costs me 5 hours to follow the toturial "start developing ios apps today" on developer.apple.com. From 7 pm 
to 12 pm yesterday, I was full of energy to work on this project. 

Actually it seems that developer.apple.com is banned currently / Jan 20, 2015 in Shanghai, China. I have to find 
a Chinese Translation version. 

Anyway, I feel very good to finish my first iOS app.
